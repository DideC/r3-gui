Saphirion's R3-GUI source code mainline

We are going to push some of our stuff to Github.
This is intended so that people from the community can use and enhance our stuff and submit pull-requests to us.
Those pull-requests will be reviewed by the Saphirion team, and if accepted, the changes are merged into our main line.

So, it will be included in our next offical release and published via our web-site (http://development.saphirion.com)
